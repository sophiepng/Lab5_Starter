Make sure you make a PR to your own repo's main and not the class' repo!! Otherwise you will lose points!!

1) I would not use unit tests for the "message" feature. While you could unit test parts of the message sending logic like formatting or validation, fully sending a message has too many components that is better for testing if integration works.  
2) I would use unit tests for the "max message length" feature because it is a self-contained piece of logic, so the test could correctly identify messages exceeding the limit and allows messages within the limit.
